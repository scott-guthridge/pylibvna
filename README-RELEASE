To create a new release:

- Make your code changes on the development branch.
- Push the development branch: `git push`
- Switch to the main branch and run `git rebase development`
- Update the version number in both pyproject.toml and meson.build
- Commit the version number with first line in this format (filling
  in the new version number):

     version 0.0.1

- Create an annotated tag in this format:

    git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "v0.0.1"

- Push:

    git push
    git push --tags

- Make sure the CI/CD process runs without errors.  If it fails,
  fix the problem and release with minor version incremented.

- Checkout the development branch and run: `git rebase main`
